# VCS SLAB Example
In this example two copper atoms on a platinum surface are simulated. The cell is fixed in all three directions. In this example a surface simulation is performed. However, it is also possible to simulate bulk materials in this mode. This can be particularly useful if the cell of the global minimum is known. This example can be started with:
```bash
python vcs_slab_ptcu.py
```
